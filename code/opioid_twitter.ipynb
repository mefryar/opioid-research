    "# Measuring Opioid Stigma Using the Twitter API and NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "More than 100 Americans each day die from [opioid overdoses](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html). Expanding access to [medication for addiction treatment (MAT)](http://adai.uw.edu/pubs/infobriefs/MAT.pdf) has the potential to help reverse the epidemic. However, [efforts to expand MAT have been blocked due to a stigmatized view of opioid addiction](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/20/15937896/medication-assisted-treatment-methadone-buprenorphine-naltrexone) as a moral failing rather than a medical condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its importance, very little data is available on opioid-related stigma. This is in part because stigma is difficult to measure with traditional tools such as surveys, which may underestimate the pervasiveness of stigma due to [social desirability bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_desirability_bias).\n",
    "\n",
    "A potentially valuable source of data to fill this gap is unstructured text data from Twitter, which is [less likely to suffer from social desirability bias](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0049124115605339) than traditional surveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to tap into this data source, we can set up a listener that uses Twitter's [Streaming API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/overview) to track opioid-related tweets."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This first-stage analysis demonstrates that conversations taking place about opioids on Twitter are correlated with real-world public health outcomes, such as overdose deaths. A quick visual comparison of the choropleth of tweet frequency (Figure 1 above) with [choropleths of overdose death rates](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html) reveals remarkable similarities. Plotting the relationship between tweet frequency and opioid overdose deaths (Figure 2) confirms that a positive correlation exists between these two indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is promising for subsequent analyses in which I will look not only at the frequency of these conversations but also their sentiment. Specifically, I plan to next look at measures of polarity and subjectivity before eventually developing a custom sentiment analysis algorithm that codes for stigma.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other next steps include:\n",
    " - Analyzing the relationship between conversations about opioids and access to treatment\n",
    " - Analyzing the relationship between conversations that specifically mention treatment and access to treatment\n",
    " - Further refining data cleaning procedures to remove suspected bots"
